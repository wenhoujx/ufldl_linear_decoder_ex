%% STEP 2: Implement sparseAutoencoderCost
%
%  You can implement all of the components (squared error cost, weight decay term,
%  sparsity penalty) in the cost function at once, but it may be easier to do 
%  it step-by-step and run gradient checking (see STEP 3) after each step.  We 
%  suggest implementing the sparseAutoencoderCost function using the following steps:
%
%  (a) Implement forward propagation in your neural network, and implement the 
%      squared error term of the cost function.  Implement backpropagation to 
%      compute the derivatives.   Then (using lambda=beta=0), run Gradient Checking 
%      to verify that the calculations corresponding to the squared error cost 
%      term are correct.
%
%  (b) Add in the weight decay term (in both the cost function and the derivative
%      calculations), then re-run Gradient Checking to verify correctness. 
%
%  (c) Add in the sparsity penalty term, then re-run Gradient Checking to 
%      verify correctness.
%
%  Feel free to change the training settings when debugging your
%  code.  (For example, reducing the training set size or 
%  number of hidden units may make your code run faster; and setting beta 
%  and/or lambda to zero may be helpful for debugging.)  However, in your 
%  final submission of the visualized weights, please use parameters we 
%  gave in Step 0 above.

[cost, grad] = sparseAutoencoderCost(theta, visibleSize, hiddenSize, lambda, ...
                                     sparsityParam, beta, patches);

%%======================================================================
%% STEP 3: Gradient Checking
%
% Hint: If you are debugging your code, performing gradient checking on smaller models 
% and smaller training sets (e.g., using only 10 training examples and 1-2 hidden 
% units) may speed things up.

% First, lets make sure your numerical gradient computation is correct for a
% simple function.  After you have implemented computeNumericalGradient.m,
% run the following: 
checkNumericalGradient();

% Now we can use it to check your cost function and derivative calculations
% for the sparse autoencoder.  
numgrad = computeNumericalGradient( @(x) sparseAutoencoderCost(x, visibleSize, ...
                                                  hiddenSize, lambda, ...
                                                  sparsityParam, beta, ...
                                                  patches), theta);

% Use this to visually compare the gradients side by side
disp([numgrad grad]); 

% Compare numerically computed gradients with the ones obtained from backpropagation
diff = norm(numgrad-grad)/norm(numgrad+grad);
disp(diff); % Should be small. In our implementation, these values are
            % usually less than 1e-9.

            % When you got this working, Congratulations!!!
